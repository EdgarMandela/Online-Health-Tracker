A website that gives out the possible ailments, problems or whataver the case is, advice on what to do in oder to prevent or eliminate. Also, medicines to cure or even the specialised clinics and the doctors to visit, as per your data feed

## Motivation:

As a new parent, I am often bombarded with some sort of health issue or another. With the addition of managing a busy schedule, it is often hard to visit a doctor right away, so the idea for creating a symptom checker that allows for a quick diagnosis came about. It is helpful to get a sense of what condition I might have in a quick and timely manner before discussing my symptoms with my primary doctor.
