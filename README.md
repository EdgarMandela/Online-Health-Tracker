# Name: Symptom Checker


## Technologies Used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery

## Purpose:

Users can add information about health issues and get possible health conditions

## Motivation:

As a new parent, I am often bombarded with some sort of health issue or another. With the addition of managing a busy schedule, it is often hard to visit a doctor right away, so the idea for creating a symptom checker that allows for a quick diagnosis came about. It is helpful to get a sense of what condition I might have in a quick and timely manner before discussing my symptoms with my primary doctor.
